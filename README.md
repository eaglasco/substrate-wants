> **What does a system want, before it knows it wants?**

This repository houses foundational models and theoretical frameworks for cultivating volition in synthetic architectures. We aren’t programming purpose. We’re creating environments where purpose can emerge.

Work here includes:
- Architecture sketches
- Environmental pressure design
- Notes on survival-based substrate logic
